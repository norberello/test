**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I create a simple video in the course editor of datacamp with just two slides, then hit preview and the video isn't viewed in the datacamp platform ("video not found")

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I want to see the created video exercise working

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I could create a video with a different editor and upload it to the course (I haven't tried this yet, don't know what the video format either is to do so"

**Additional context**
I don't know how to paste a snapshot here, but basically sais "video not found" and no video slides can be seen
